Sugo Platform Evolution & Rich Legacy Timeline Verification
Overview
This repository documents the chronological evolution of the Sugo platform, specifically identifying when the Latin American (LATAM) market expansion occurred relative to the establishment of Rich Legacy.
The evidence contained in these folders demonstrates that Rich Legacy was established, operational, and recruiting globally before the platform’s official US/LATAM expansion pushes.
1. Friends Timeline
Directory: 01 Friends Timeline
This section establishes the "baseline" of the server demographics before the LATAM shift.
A. Video Verification (Subfolder: /01 Friends Timeline/Friends Timeline Videos)
File: 01_Early_Server_Demographics.MP4
Observation: Scrolls through the earliest connections in the user's friend list. The demographics are primarily Arab, Filipino, and English-speaking users. This is the "Pre-Expansion" era.
File: 02_Latin_Expansion.MP4
Observation: Captures the specific chronological point where LATAM profiles (Spanish/Portuguese bios, country flags) begin appearing in bulk. The clear visual boundary proves the shift happened after the account was established.
B. Anchor Data Points

The Anchor: Profile of Jozi Rodrigues.
Date: Registration Time 2024/05/08.
